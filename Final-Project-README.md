#Branch Final-Project-Python-IT-101-B

 This project includes a class file birthdayClass.py from which functions are called to perform necessary
 operations to run this birthday.py script
    This program takes command line arguments
        # 'Add' --to add a member to the list.
        # 'Delete' --to delete a member from the existing list.
        # 'Run'  --to run the script with existing list and send email to members.
        # No command line arguments will simply run the script with existing list and send email to members.
 First we need to create two text file through 'Add' which creates and saves the data:
    birthday_list.txt -- to store dob and name related values
                            example: 26-August BOB,GARRY
                                     2-July DAN

    email_list.txt -- to store name and email related values
                            example: BOB bob@gmail.com
                                     GARRY garry@gmail.com

 In this program we will be working with Gmail host alone and dob in dd-mm pattern (example 26-03)
